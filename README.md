# QuantumChain

## Project Description

QuantumChain is an innovative smart contract project that introduces quantum-inspired security mechanisms to blockchain technology. By leveraging quantum computing concepts such as entanglement and superposition principles, QuantumChain creates a more secure and resilient decentralized network infrastructure.

The project implements a novel approach to node management and verification using quantum-inspired algorithms, providing enhanced security features that go beyond traditional blockchain implementations. Each quantum node in the network maintains an entanglement level that contributes to the overall network security and consensus mechanism.
